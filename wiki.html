			<div class="panel-heading">Purpose of FullUse</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p class="text-justify">Students nowadays might feel pressured with the increasing workload. Poor time management also costs students dearly. Physics tutor Tony Chee, 35, who gives tuition to about 150 secondary and junior college students, said: “Closer to the exams, students usually feel there is much content to absorb. As a result of time constraints, they are more stressed and this may affect their revision.” This shows that better time management is needed among students.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">In 2011, researchers conducted a study, asking 739 college students to provide their own perspective as to why students fail courses and drop out of colleges. Respondents saw insufficient academic skills as closely related to the lack of time management skills, often mentioning the two in the same sentence. They even ranked poor time management and poor organizational skills second as a major roadblock to student success.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">FullUse aims to solve these problems by <b>improving the time management skills of students so that they can live a better work life, be it scoring well in tests or meeting deadlines consistently</b>.</p>

			<div class="panel-heading">Smart To-Do List</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p class="text-justify">FullUse has a Smart To-Do List to help users keep track of what they do. The Smart To Do List is split into 2 sections: the <b>Short Term Tasks</b> and the <b>Long Term Tasks</b>.

				<div class="panel-group" id="accordion">
					<div class="panel panel-default">

								<a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#STT" class="anchor-fixed">Short Term Tasks <span class="caret"></span></a><a name="STTHEADER" class="anchor">.</a>

						<div id="STT" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
							<div class="panel-body">
								<p>These denote what users want to do within a few days. (e.g. Math Assignment 1, English Literature Analysis, etc.) They consist of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li class="text-justify"><b><a class="anchor-fixed">Task Title</a>:<a name="STTTASKTITLE" class="anchor">.</a></b> The name of the user’s task. After keying in the Task Title, FullUse will automatically come up with suggestions for tags for the task title. Tags can be used to identify tasks by subjects (e.g. tagging “Worksheet 1” as “MATH”). In the To Do List, users can search for tasks by tag as well as edit tasks by tapping on the Task Title.</li>
									<li class="text-justify"><b><a class="anchor-fixed">Task Priority</a>:<a name="STTTASKPRIORITY" class="anchor">.</a></b> This denotes how important a task is. It is represented by exclamation marks (!!! &rarr; High Priority, !! &rarr; Medium Priority, ! &rarr; Low Priority).  The Smart To Do List is sorted according to priority, with the most important task(s) at the top of the list and bolded.</li>
									<li class="text-justify"><b><a class="anchor-fixed">Task Due Date</a>:<a name="STTTASKDUEDATE" class="anchor">.</a></b> This denotes when users’ Short Term Task is due by. Users will be notified 2 days and 1 day before the due date, at a specific time that can be set in the settings (default 0900AM). Every time a notification is sent, the task priority will be increased by 1 exclamation mark. This ensures that by the time the task is due, the task’s priority is High (!!!) and it is bolded. Overdue tasks will be highlighted in red and bolded.</li>

									<li class="text-justify"><b><a class="anchor-fixed">Task End Date</a>:<a name="LTTTASKENDDATE" class="anchor">.</a></b> This represents when the user’s Long Term Task is due. Users will be notified 2 weeks and 1 week before this End Date, at the same time that users are notified of Short Term Tasks. The Task Priority will also increase by 1 exclamation mark every time a notification is sent. FullUse will autocomplete the Long Term Task once its end date is due.</li>
